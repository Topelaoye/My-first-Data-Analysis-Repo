# Project Name: AN ANALYSIS OF BILLIONAIRES LISTED BY FORBES
This is my first project as a Data Analyst. It was an analysis of Billionaires listed by Forbes  

-----
# Project Objective: Problem Statement

I wanted to see the youngest, oldest, and topmost billionaires. I was also interested in the marital status of these 'big boys ' and have a general view of which countries of the world and industries have the richest individuals 

--------
# Data Sourcing

I got the dataset of billionaires listed in Forbes from Kaggle

------
# Data Transformation

I used Microsoft Excel to clean up and transform the data and used the Pivot tables for the dashboard

------
# Findings
Here are a few of my findings:
